        "text": "All the elements in <Composition 1-4 (Division - Unity)> (2020), such as points, lines, and faces, are accumulated step by step according to Kandinsky;\nthis results in <Block> (2020), which ultimately leads to <Block installation art> (2020), where blocks and blocks meet and create strange tension.\nIt is here that 'tension' is defined as not external forms that exist within pictorial works, rather as the struggle or difficulties of living within them, that is, intrinsic values or psychological relationships.\nA 'composition' concludes each relationship, creating an equal balance or confrontation of power, as in <Block Installation Art> (2020).\nFinally, this tension relationship then accompanies all form elements according to the principle by arranging the vivid power contained within.\nThus, a work's content is expressed in a composition, that is, in a whole in which essential tensions are expressed.\nSo Wonhyuk Son's Block painting is a rhythm that repeats the contraction and expansion created by pictorial elements, and it is a resonance that is organized by subordinating it internally and underlining its purpose.\nSimilarly, 'Twisted Harmony' (2018) can also be viewed as a representative work which creates an invisible tension relationship between dots, lines, and planes, and concludes with a composition.",

It is possible,\nhowever, that all of these processes are dissipating.\nAs the starting point of the form that leads to the line and the plane, it is also the disappearance point of the form when the form is erased and erased.\nIt is close to the essence of things, and it also represents the spirit and attitude of contemporary art that converges indefinitely without beginning or end.\nIn the end, Wonhyuk Son's work brings us to a certain unknown point.\nIs this the point of origin or the point of disappearance of the form?"
